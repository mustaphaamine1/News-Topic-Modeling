But how valid is the buzz around ChatGPT? We unpack what you need to know: How does generative AI work? Who are the key players? Is ChatGPT ready for prime time? And most importantly: How will the technology change the way we do business?\n\nInsider Intelligence\n\nSo what exactly is generative AI and why should you care? Generative AI is artificial intelligence that creates content from simple prompts and context. This new technology can be used to create everything from essays to 3D objects and newer models can even combine more than one capability.\n\nGenerative AI comprised less than 1% of total US venture capital (VC) funding of $238.3 billion in 2022, according to PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). But an estimated 450 startups and several new funds for generative AI indicate a hot market and high hopes for growth.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT and how does it fit into the equation? ChatGPT is a conversational AI model built by OpenAI (GPT stands for generative pretrained transformer). Released November 30, 2022, as a proof of concept, it gained 1 million users in five days and blasted into the popular consciousness. Despite the excitement many limitations and challenges remain and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted a warning about ChatGPT: \"it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.\"\n\nGenerative AI models simulate how we think by relying on algorithms that \"learn\" with each use. They start with millions of labeled pictures, text, or other media, and gradually identify patterns that allow them to understand and create content independently. Humans often fine-tune a model as it evolves. Although OpenAI is the best-known generative AI company, it's not the only one.\n\nCreative industries have already started to feel the change of workflows due to generative AI. Copywriters, designers, coders, photo and video editors, and even strategists now have access to generative AI tools that can simplify their day-to-day tasks. However, it has the potential to disrupt some businesses and will spark backlash over accuracy, fairness, and plagiarism.\n\nGenerative AI is triggering a communications revolution that will make it much easier to research, create, and test content. And the changes will likely happen more quickly than in past content revolutions. Want to learn more about ChatGPT and Generative AI?

And it has caught the attention of payments services providers keen to unlock the potential of the generative AI that powers it.\n\nInsider Intelligence\n\nGenerative AI is set to revolutionize various sub-verticals within the payments industry. The most significant impact is expected to be seen in payment networks, mobile wallet providers, and issuing banks.\n\nOver the next few years, we expect to see many positive use cases for generative AI. The most viable and valuable are believed to be in authentic chat, personalization, credit scoring, payment optimization, and fraud detection. On the other hand, there are a couple of not-so-promising use cases for generative AI in payments which include security and compliance.\n\nWhile generative AI's rise may seem sudden, it will take a considerable time for industries to fully embrace its disruptive impact.

At least 288 people have died in India's worst rail crash in over two decades, officials said on Saturday, after a passenger train went off the tracks and hit another one in an accident a preliminary report blamed on signal failure.\n\nOne train in Friday's accident also hit a freight train parked nearby in the district of Balasore in Odisha state in the east of the country, leaving a tangled mess of smashed rail cars and injuring 803.\n\nThe death toll has reached 288, said K. S. Anand, chief public relations officer of the South Eastern Railway.\n\nDead bodies are still trapped in the mangled coaches and the rescue operation is continuing, a Reuters witness said, while the death toll is expected to rise.\n\nA preliminary report indicates that the accident was the result of signal failure, Anand said.\n\n\"The Coromandel Express was supposed to travel on the main line, but a signal was given for the loop line instead, and the train rammed into a goods train already parked over there. Its coaches then fell onto the tracks on either side, also derailing the Howrah Superfast Express,\" he said.\n\nSurviving passenger Anubha Das said he would never forget the scene. \"Families crushed away, limbless bodies and a bloodbath on the tracks,\" he said.\n\nVideo footage showed derailed train coaches and damaged tracks, with rescue teams searching the mangled carriages to pull the survivors out and rush them to hospital.\n\nDead bodies were lying on the bloodstained floor of a school used as a makeshift morgue, and police helped relatives identify the bodies, covered with white cloths and placed inside chained bags.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the scene, talked to rescue workers and inspected the wreckage. He also met the survivors at hospitals.\n\n\"(I) took stock of the situation at the site of the tragedy in Odisha. Words can't capture my deep sorrow. We stand committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected,\" Modi said.\n\nA witness involved in rescue operations said the screams and cries of the injured and the relatives of those killed were chilling. \"It was horrific and heart-wrenching,\" he said.\n\nFamilies of the dead will receive 1 million rupees ($12,000), while the seriously injured will get 200,000 rupees, with 50,000 rupees for minor injuries, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.
