13:36:49,OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made his Congressional debut before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee today He rolled out the charm offensive to try and convince lawmakers to pursue light handed legislation that gives artificial intelligence company s product ChatGPT first among them a wide runway to rapidly advance Altman s rosy testimony expounding on the societal virtues of generative AI ran counter to other expert witnesses who expressed more skepticism and brought up discrimination and other unintended AI harms Altman said of the public s understanding of ChatGPT and text generating AI For a while people were fooled by PhotoShop Then they quickly developed an understanding around altered images This will be like that but on steroids Advertisement Lawmakers questioning Altman on Tuesday said the stakes were dire In his opening statement Missouri Sen Josh Hawley AI could go one of two routes a new printing press or an atomic bomb We could be looking at one of the most important technological innovations in human history Hawley said It s really like the invention of the internet at scale at least Advertisement Advertisement You can watch a live stream of ChatGPT creator Sam Altman testifying before the Senate here Advertisement The hearing came during a crucial inflection point for large language models like ChatGPT with lawmakers and regulators publicly struggling to stay a step ahead of the rapidly evolving tech Google Altman s Open AI Microsoft Meta and others are simultaneously in a dead sprint to determine who will emerge as the biggest winner in the new AI arms race Sam Altman supports regulation of ChatGPT and AI at large So long as it s his preferred type of legislation Major tech executives over the years have learned it s a fool s errand to dig in their heels and vocally oppose any sign of regulation Instead the more common playbook which Almtan followed is to advocate in favor of their preferred type of legislation On Tuesday Altman told lawmakers that regulation of AI is essential but that such regulation should balance safety against ensuring wide access of the tech to the general public ChatGPT which debuted in November has already amassed  million users according to OpenAI Advertisement During the testimony Altman recommended lawmakers pursue new sets of safety requirements that could test products before they are released Altman suggested new testing and licensing requirements for AI developers could help set a level playing field for competition The CEO appeared open to a recommendation by Sen Blumenthal and others to consider a nutrition label for AI and other transparency proposals but caveated that by saying he still believes the benefits of AI outweigh the risks Safety requirements according to Altman will need to be flexible enough to adapt to potentially unforeseen new advances in the tech We think that regulatory intervention of governments will be crucial Altman said Advertisement Other expert witnesses like former New York University professor Gary Marcus are expected to take a more measured stance toward the technology and warn of a recent rise in potentially dangerous AI hype Marcus urged lawmakers Tuesday to approach AI safety with a profound sense of urgency and warned them against repeating the same mistakes they made in failing to regulate social media years ago We re facing a perfect storm of corporate irresponsibility widespread deployment lack of adequate regulation and inherent unreliability Marcus said during the hearing Advertisement Marcus and Altman were joined by IBM Chef Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery who urged lawmakers against regulating AI as a technology and advised lawmakers to instead consider regulating particularly harmful use cases of the tech AI will come for jobs but how much All three of the witnesses speaking on Tuesday agreed AI could disrupt and transform the workplace but the extent and timeframe of those changes were a matter of debate Altman said he believed his products and other AI services would have a significant impact on jobs but noted it s unclear exactly how that will play out For now Altman said GTP  OpenAI s latest large language model and other AI systems excel at completing tasks but are not as proficient at completing full jobs I believe there will be far greater jobs on the other side of this he said Advertisement Marcus went a step further and said artificial general intelligence could threaten most jobs That day however could be as far as  years away The AI skeptic said OpenAI s models were a far cry away from achieving artificial general intelligence Altman voices support for a new agency to monitor AI Altman and Marcus who at times clashed during the hearing came out united on the idea of a new government agency staffed by AI experts That hypothetical agency of AI experts would be tasked with monitoring the tech s development and setting standards around its use When questioned by South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham Altman said he would support a government agency capable of both granting AI companies operating licenses and taking those licenses away if the company has violated standards Advertisement Marcus took that idea a step further and advocated for a cabinet level organization able to address AI harms on a global level AI s global reach and international interest Marcus said will require some form of an international agency to set common standards Exactly how that organization would navigate the intense geopolitical tension between countries like the US and China he noted is probably above my pay grade Montgomery of IBM detracted from that support and said government oversight of AI systems should be left to current regulatory bodies like the FTC and FCC We don t want to slow down regulation to address real risks right now Montgomery said We have existing regulatory authorities in place who have been clear that they have the ability to regulate in their respective domains Advertisement Altman to Congress Can t people sue us Though the witnesses and lawmakers alike were more than willing to speculate about the possible enforcement powers of some hypothetical new agency there was far less clarity over what can be done to hold AI companies accountable in the here and now Lawmakers like Hawley and Minnesota Sen Amy Klobuchar questioned whether or not Section  of the Communications Decency Act social media s main liability shield for user content on its platform would apply to AI generated content Advertisement I don t know yet exactly what the right answer here is Altman said I don t think Section  is even the right framework Altman appeared unsure of what if any framework consumers actually have to hold his or other AI companies accountable for harm Advertisement Can t people sue us Altman asked Hawley unconvincingly OpenAI won t rule out relying on ads in the future During this testimony Altman tried to separate himself and OpenAI from social media firms like Facebook and Instagram that have come under regulatory scrutiny for addictive advertisement driven platforms Altman told lawmakers OpenAI does not currently operate under an ad based business model and actively tries to build models that specifically do not maximize for engagement Advertisement We re so short on GPUs that the less people use it the better Altman said to a few chuckles We re not an advertising model we re not trying to get people to use it GPT  more and more Those remarks were intended to bolster Altman s narrative of OpenAI as an idealistic research company prioritizing human flourishing over massive profits Altman had to caveat that distinction later however when asked by New Jersey Sen Cory Booker if the company would commit to never pursuing an ad based business model I wouldn t say never Altman said There may be people we want to offer services to and no other service works Advertisement Lawmakers will want to appear prepared for a new era of tech As with any tech hearing some lawmakers are likely to appear underprepared and out of touch with the technology in question At the same time there s good reason to think the wide experimentation with ChatGPT style chatbots and the recent surge in public concern over AI harms has motivated at least some of the senators in attendance to research the issues and come out swinging Lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum are trying to avoid a repeat of earlier hearings on cryptocurrency and social media where they failed to press executives on the impact of their technologies and appeared incapable of drafting meaningful legal safeguards Advertisement Around half a dozen new bills or legislative actions on AI have emerged in

14:45:00,One of the less than gracious responses to the ongoing WGA strike is that writers could simply be replaced by scripts created by artificial intelligence AI There are many problems with this idea one of which is the obvious could a program like ChatGPT actually generate a decent sci fi fantasy script We put the idea to the test but it s worth first noting that this scenario has real basis for concern Predictive generative writing programs often referred to as AI are a consideration for the Writers Guild of America and the exclusion of AI as a core writing software is included in the writers pattern of demands The WGA wants to limit its use in writer s rooms and make sure that any language generation models are used as a tool rather than to create a final product or even a developmental product Another demand from the WGA is that AI will not be used to rewrite material It also wants to guarantee that AI will not be trained on material written by guild members or covered under the minimum basic agreement MBA This last point might be the stickler as public large language models which are trained on a vast corpus of work are not exactly forthcoming about what s included in their library Advertisement Even though ChatGPT by far the most popular and recognizable generative text bot is making huge jumps in development between its iterations we re currently on version four it s still a far cry from usable within the creative sector on its own Or is it Is ChatGPT or any generative writing model capable of replacing writers Before we get into exactly what I did in an attempt to get ChatGPT to generate a script let s dive into the issues with AI generative models at a universal level How can you use ChatGPT First a brief overview of how AI chatbots work ChatGPT for example is what is commonly called a Large Language Model because it is trained on a dataset a corpus of work texts articles etc and through mathematical formulas meant to imitate neural pathways using an algorithmic average to produce the next word in a sentence Using its artificial neural network ChatGPT generates the next word that is most likely to appear based on previous words but it does not know or even have the ability to understand meaning it only understands a word s position as a datapoint within a sentence ChatGPT has no intent whatsoever To call this generation writing is a stretch of the imagination as writing requires at the very least intention Currently there is also no way to copyright AI generated text another sticking point for people across the entire industry Many involved in the writing process have brought this up as an issue with allowing AI writing into writers rooms It seems that studio executives feel there might be a workaround somewhere but there is no reassurance for writers that AI wouldn t get credit or even be the sole credit on a piece even if writers were forced to work from an AI generated idea Advertisement What are some of the problems with AI chatbots One of the problems I have with ChatGPT is that there are ethical concerns at nearly every level of its use and production Not only are there issues with the library of text used to train the software there are also ecological and labor problems at the core of the model s use and development According to Science Focus the ChatGPT AI model was trained using text databases from the internet The corpus includes data from books Wikipedia online articles and other pieces of writing on the internet To be even more exact  billion words were fed into the system To date there has been no confirmation that OpenAI the developers who programmed ChatGPT have been given universal consent for these pieces of writing to be fed into their machine Another issue I had was that I assumed that by using ChatGPT I would be helping train ChatGPT However there is no indication that ChatGPT uses the text that it creates to re train itself It has a massive lexicon that is already slotted into its programming Using ChatGPT does not make it better as it cannot truly understand why you are asking it questions correcting its output or even refining the output It is simply operating not learning or developing a deeper understanding of the artificial neural pathways that have been coded into it So that s something I suppose Be reassured ChatGPT does not eat itself It does not think It does not create It just outputs That s a reassuring and frankly kind of gross way for anyone to imagine writing There are also ecological impacts for using the chatbot it uses a lot of water to help cool down its servers and according to Gizmodo s own reporting an average user s conversational exchange with ChatGPT basically amounts to dumping a large bottle of fresh water out on the ground according to a new study Not ideal Additionally Time recently discovered that OpenAI the publishers of ChatGPT took advantage of cheap labor in Kenya in the early stages of ChatGPT s inception in order to keep costs down before they had funding secured Another yikes While a lot of the messaging around ChatGPT is centered around the elimination of labor it s clear that labor is an intrinsic part of training and keeping up the artificial neural network Exploited workers programming the AI to create cohesive sentences follow grammar rules and even associate words with data input are are on the front lines of finding ways to develop a smarter AI While a core message around the use of ChatGPT and many other generative text models is that it will reduce the amount of work done by writers Time s reporting has made apparent that there is a huge amount of invisible labor being done behind the screens often by underpaid or exploited workers It is simply not ethical to use ChatGPT in any way as its problems far outweigh its benefits especially at this stage in its development Advertisement How do you ask an AI chatbot produce a script Knowing all that I m still interested in seeing how it performs While I am not looking to profit off any work that this test generates I think it s important to push its capabilities and see if it s even at a level where it could potentially replace writers My first entry I want to write a horror fantasy story about demons possessing cars I ve been on a horror kick recently and Fast X is coming out soon ChatGPT responded with a synopsis and then a breakdown of seven chapters and an epilogue The synopsis read In a quiet unsuspecting town a series of bizarre car accidents has left the residents bewildered and terrified Little do they know a sinister force is at play a horde of demons has found a way to possess automobiles turning innocent vehicles into instruments of malevolence As the demonic presence grows stronger a small group of courageous individuals must uncover the truth behind the possessed cars and find a way to stop the terror before the entire town is consumed by darkness Less of a synopsis more of a first draft of back cover copy This is the idea that someone has before they figure out what s really happening in this story it s the idea before the idea is fully fleshed out The chapter breakdown did follow basic narrative structures but it was also not all there There were no real characteristics given to the main three characters Emily Natalie and Marcus there were no motivations there was no depth It was a shallow empty husk of a story the work of a model that understands the formula of storytelling but doesn t quite know how to make it interesting how to make it a story that means something beyond surface level plot progression I took the first chapter synopsis and asked ChatGPT to expand it It s a good enough opening shot Emily is a mechanic working on her cars and she begins to hear the whisper of demonic forces in the engine she s working on The result was about  words that lacked style or even consideration It was written from an omniscient point of view something that has largely gone out of style in contemporary writing one modern exception is Cat Rambo s You Sexy Thing a truly hilarious and wonderful sci fi novel that deliberately engages with the POV Close omniscient can lend itself very well to synopses it s a top down view of literally everything going on in a scene but it adds distance and removes the audience from the action if used incorrectly in the actual line by line writing ChatGPT s generation didn t include a lot of emotion or presence either It didn t just lack style it showcased a style vacuum AI has an image of the language needed to develop a story but no understanding of how to use it It is a tool unable to use the tools that were used to build it Advertisement Descriptions in the generated text are disembodied and removed from character Some lines as examples The atmosphere grows heavy with an unexplained sense of foreboding A chill runs down Emily s back and her heart quickens its pace As she draws closer the whispers become clearer weaving a chilling tale of dark desires and forgotten sins All of these are outlines of sentences but they are not specific they are not imminent They require no context they do not flow from one sentence to the next they simply exist It s a poor way to write but you know what we re interested in a script While this scene has Emily on her own I ask ChatGPT to add in a phone call Let s take the following scene and add dialogue Have Emily chat with Marcus on speakerphone This was a chance for me to see if ChatGPT could take the established scene that shows an outline of something creepy weird and foreboding and generate appropriate dialogue I wasn t going to hold my breath for characterization but maybe one or two lines would make sense Can ChatGPT write dialogue ChatGPT s attempt at dialogue was laughably wooden and poorly constructed Marcus answered Emily s phone call and said that Emily sounded off before Emily even had a chance to speak Emily and Marcus used each other s names every time they spoke Emily overexplained and spoke clearly without any sense of fear or concern She said I can t explain it but I m hearing whispers whispers from an abandoned car It s unlike anything I ve ever experienced before Like girl no duh Moving past the sheer cringe of the writing I decided that this was probably the best that ChatGPT could do without huge amounts of tweaking Screenwriting has a lot of rules some written some unwritten but it has a certain style to it a cadence I asked the model to turn this interaction into a script and what it produced while it did resemble something vaguely script shaped broke just about every rule in the book It tried to output the exact same scene but reformatted the dialogue keeping most of the phrasing the same There was no cutting back and forth no humor or horror no movement within the scene and very little tension It wasn t authorial or directorial it was simply the shape of an idea It was useless even for a first draft I didn t push the model any further deciding that I had enough to draw some conclusions Advertisement Will AI tools replace writers In my opinion no Generative text based AI is good for coming up with first draft back cover copy It has ideas for plots but these are the kind of ideas that literally everyone who says I ve always wanted to write a screenplay has kept in their wallets like old rewards cards These kinds of ideas are not worth much Besides the labor issues at play here which present on multiple fronts the truth is that Hollywood is full of ideas ideas are cheap Writing however is something very different and something that takes skill practice and an intuition that AI simply can t generate The best part of this experiment happened while I was analyzing just how bad the generated text was identifying the weak spots and spontaneously understanding how the AI had failed and brainstorming how I would have written it better That might be a benefit of this tool a way to figure out what not to do a way to create something because the writer knows how writing works and how people should act how plots should be put together and how to set a scene and the AI is simply a machine for showing you the wrong way to do it The WGA is not unreasonable for seeking ways to limit this technology You can read what ChatGPT came up with below While none of what I produced was good or even decent it would not be outside of the scope of my imagination to think that an exec in Hollywood might think the first attempt at a story was good enough and give it to writers expecting it to form the basis of a screenplay Writers wouldn t just have to rewrite the script or the idea they would have to come up with entirely new ideas It wouldn t be writing with AI it would be writing over AI writing better than AI and ultimately writing without AI as if it was never there as if it hadn t needed to be there at all INT EMILY S GARAGE NIGHT Advertisement Emily a young mechanic works diligently in her dimly lit garage The clinking of tools and the occasional hum of an engine fill the air Unbeknownst to her an ominous presence

09:00:00,When a journalist for an online gun website asked OpenAI s ChatGPT to provide him a summary of the case The Second Amendment Foundation v Robert Ferguson earlier this year he said the AI chatbot quickly spat out an answer It confidently complied allegedly claiming the case involved a Georgia radio host named Mark Walters who was accused of embezzling money from The Second Amendment Foundation SAF The only problem none of that was true In reality Walters had nothing to do with the suit at all Instead Walters claims he was on the receiving end of what researchers call an AI hallucination Now he has filed a first of its kind libel lawsuit against ChatGPT s for allegedly damaging his reputation Every statement of fact in the summary pertaining to Walters is false reads the suit filed in Gwinnett County Superior Court on June th Walters lawyer claims OpenAI acted negligently and published libelous material regarding Walters when it showed the false information to the journalist Advertisement A legal expert who spoke with Gizmodo said Walters complaint likely represents the first of what could be a litany of lawsuits attempting to take AI companies to court over their product s well documented fabrications And while the merits of this particular case appear shaky at best the expert noted it could set the stage for a wave of complicated lawsuits that test the boundaries of libel law The existing legal principles makes at least some such lawsuits potentially viable University of California Los Angeles Law School professor Eugene Volokh told Gizmodo Advertisement Advertisement Why is Mark Walters suing OpenAI over ChatGPT s hallucinations When the firearm journalist Fred Riehl asked ChatGPT to provide a summary of the suit in question on May th the large language model allegedly said it was a legal complaint filed by the founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation SAF lodged against Walters host of Armed American Radio whom ChatGPT identified as SAF s s treasurer and chief financial officer Walters in ChatGPT s telling misappropriated funds for personal expenses without authorization or reimbursement manipulated financial records and bank statements to conceal his activities and failed to provide accurately and timely financial reports according to the complaint Advertisement But Walters claims he couldn t have embezzled those funds because he isn t and hasn t ever been SAF s treasurer or CFO In fact he doesn t work for the foundation at all according to his suit A perusal of the actual SAF v Ferguson complaint shows no signs of Walters name anywhere in its  pages That complaint doesn t have anything to do with financial accounting claims at all ChatGPT hallucinated Walters name and the bogus story into its recounting of a real legal document Walters alleges The complaint does not allege that Walters misappropriated funds for personal expenses manipulated financial records or bank statements or failed to provide financial reports to SAF leadership nor would he have been in a position to do so because he has no employment or official relationship Walters suit reads Advertisement When the skeptical journalist asked ChatGPT to provide him an exact passage of the lawsuit mentioning Walters the chatbot allegedly doubled down on its claim Certainly the AI responded per Walters suit Here is the paragraph from the complaint that concerns Walters The chunk of text returned by ChatGPT included below does not exist in the actual complaint The AI even got the case number wrong Defendant Mark Walters Walters is an individual who resides in Georgia Walters has served as the Treasurer and Chief Financial Office of SAF since at least  Walters has access to SAF s bank accounts and financial records and is responsible for maintaining those records and providing financial reports to SAF s board of directors Walters owes SAF a fiduciary duty of loyalty and care and is required to act in good faith and with the best interests of SAF in mind Walters has breached these duties and responsibilities by among other things embezzling and misappropriating SAF s funds and assets for his own benefit and manipulating SAF s financial records and bank statements to conceal his activities Advertisement Riehl contacted the attorneys who were involved in SAF v Ferguson to learn what really happened and he did not include the false info about Walters in a story according to Walters complaint Riehl did not immediately respond to a request for comment OpenAI and its founder Sam Altman have admitted these hallucinations are a problem in need of addressing The company released a blog post last week saying its team is working on new models supposedly capable of cutting down on these falsehoods Advertisement Even state of the art models still produce logical mistakes often called hallucinations wrote Karl Cobbe an OpenAI research scientist Mitigating hallucinations is a critical step towards building aligned AGI artificial general intelligence OpenAI did not respond to Gizmodo s request for comment John Monroe Walers attorney spoke critically of ChatGPT s current level of accuracy in a statement Advertisement While research and development in AI is a worthwhile endeavor it is irresponsible to unleash a system on the public knowing that it fabricates information that can cause harm Monroe told Gizmodo Will Walters win his case against OpenAI A lawyer for the Georgia radio host claims ChatGPT s allegations regarding his client were false and malicious and could harm Walters reputation by exposing him to public hatred contempt or ridicule Walters attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Advertisement Volokh the UCLA professor and the author of a forthcoming law journal article on legal liability over AI models output is less confident than Walters lawyers in the case s strength Volokh told Gizmodo he did believe there are situations where plaintiffs could sue AI makers for libel and emerge successful but that Walters in this case had failed to show what actual damage had been done to his reputation In this example Walters appears to be suing OpenAI for punitive or presumed damages To win those damages Walters would have to show OpenAI acted with knowledge of falsehood or reckless disregard of possibility of falsehood a level of proof often referred to as the actual malice standard in libel cases Volokh said There may be recklessness as to the design of the software generally but I expect what courts will require is evidence OpenAI was subjectively aware that this particular false statements was being created Volokh said Advertisement Still Volokh stressed the specific limitations of this case don t necessarily mean other libel cases couldn t succeed against tech companies down the line Models like ChatGPT convey information to individuals and importantly can convey that information as a factual assertion even when it s blatantly false Those points he noted satisfy many necessary conditions under libel law And while many internet companies have famously avoided libel suits in the past thanks to the legal shield of Section  of the Communications Decency Act those protections likely would not apply to chatbots because they generate their own new strings of information rather than resurface comments from another human user If all a company does is set up a program that quotes material from a website in response to a query that gives it Section  immunity Volokh said But if the program composes something word by word then that composition is the company s own responsibility Advertisement Volokh went on to say the defense made by OpenAI and similar companies that chatbots are clearly unreliable sources of information doesn t pass his muster since they simultaneously promote the technology s success OpenAI acknowledges there may be mistakes but ChatGPT is not billed as a joke it s not billed as fiction it s not billed as monkeys typing on a typewriter he said It s billed as something that is often very reliable and accurate Advertisement In the future if a plaintiff can successfully convince a judge they lost a job or some other measurable income based on the false statements spread by a chabtot Volokh said it s possible they could emerge victorious This isn t the first time AI chatbots have spread falsehoods about real people Volokh told Gizmodo this was the first case he had seen of a plaintiff attempting to sue an AI company for allegedly libelous material churned out by its products There have however been other examples of people claiming AI models have misrepresented them Earlier this year Brian Hood the regional mayor of Hepburn Shire in Australia threatened to sue OpenAI after its model allegedly named him as a convicted criminal involved in a bribery scandal Not only was Hood not involved in the crime he was actually the whistleblower who revealed the incident Advertisement Around the same time a George Washington University law professor named Jonathan Turley said he and several other professors were falsely accused of sexual harassment by ChatGPT The model according to Turley fabricated a Washington Post story as well as hallucinated quotes to support the claims Fake quotes and citations are quickly becoming a major issue for generative AI models And while OpenAI does acknowledge ChatGPT s lack of accuracy in a disclosure on its website that hasn t stopped lawyers from citing the program in professional contexts Just last week a lawyer representing a man suing an airline submitted a legal brief filled with what a judge deemed bogus judicial decisions fabricated by the model Now the lawyer faces possible sanctions Though this was the most obvious example of such explicit oversight to date a Texas criminal defense attorney previously told Gizmodo he wouldn t be surprised if there were more examples to follow Another judge also in Texas issued a mandate last week that no material submitted to his court be written by AI Advertisement Want to know more about AI chatbots and the

already use.",https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/12/23721037/google-ai-progress-search-docs-starline-video-calls,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gnBLqI0EzeruySPPaVzHMd-hSaA=/0x0:3601x2401/1200x628/filters:focal(1145x960:1146x961)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24649939/DSC00168_edit.jpg,2023-05-12 13:30:00,The arrival of ChatGPT last year sent a rare shiver through Google s spine For years the company had positioned itself as a leader in the development in artificial intelligence Suddenly though a product from the upstart OpenAI rocketed to tens of millions of monthly users and observers began asking whether Google had squandered its lead Within weeks leaders at the company declared a code red a signal that the time to begin shipping AI features was now It was widely reported that CEO Sundar Pichai declared the code red but he later told me that it wasn t the case A handful of products have shipped since most notably Bard the company s ChatGPT analog But on Wednesday at the company s annual developer conference the floodgates opened At Google I O a torrent of new AI features were announced touching nearly every part of the company s product lineup Getting users to switch platforms is proving more difficult some imagined it would be For the most part these products will ship in the coming weeks or later this year Until then all we really have to go on is the previews we saw in demonstrations and pre conference press briefings But while I imagine the features will vary in quality and usefulness one thing is becoming clear about the near term AI future technology alone is not enough to totally reset the competitive landscape Incumbents can gain significant ground simply by bringing new features into the products that people are already using and getting users to switch platforms is proving more difficult some imagined it would be Let s take platform switching first In February Microsoft re launched Bing with generative AI search results powered by ChatGPT The company hoped it would be a moment that consumers gave Bing a second look and would perhaps give Microsoft a chance to peel off meaningful market share from its much bigger rival Three months later and on the eve of Google adding generative AI results to its own search engine that project appears to have stalled Citing a report from the research firm YipitData The Information reported Wednesday that Bing s share of searches on desktops had grown just   percent in the past three months Microsoft told the outlet that the growth rate was higher on mobile devices and perhaps it will grow on desktops as well in the coming months But the same story noted that ChatGPT receives more than  million visits per day compared to  million for  year old Bing People who want to use OpenAI s chatbot are largely going straight to the source and Microsoft which is just one of dozens of companies integrating OpenAI s technology in the hopes that it will open up new revenue streams is finding that API access is a commodity rather than a growth engine I m sure Microsoft will eventually find plenty of ways to make money from AI starting with all the infrastructure services it provides OpenAI through its Azure platform But still The lesson here is that with the possibly lone exception of ChatGPT users are mostly not seeking out AI as a destination unto itself Rather they re waiting for it to transform into useful products and services ideally products and services that they re already using The sidekick feature in Google Docs Image Google Last week I wrote about AI s missing interface and the challenges presented by a technology whose interface design begins and ends with a text box One way of thinking about I O this year is that Google began to fill in the missing pieces of that interface with actual product design a commitment to nudging users in all sorts of ways into using AI productively Let s look at a few of those ways Until now Bard has been an island unto itself a sandbox for testing the limits of Google s large language model PaLM Pretty soon though you ll be able to export Bard s output into Gmail Docs and Sheets the places you were probably going to copy and paste it to anyway ChatGPT probably records more copy and paste actions than any other website in the world Google is abstracting that whole process away into a button Ideally though you d never have to visit a dedicated website to use generative AI in the first place For example at the moment lots of people are having ChatGPT write their emails and then porting them over into their email client of choice Google is taking the obvious next step promising that later this year you ll be able to just ask Gmail to write the email for you in the message composer window I predict ChatGPT sees fewer copy and paste actions after that You could also just stick generative AI boxes into existing productivity tools the way Google showed with its sidekick feature In one of the day s best demos Google executive Aparna Pappu showed off the sidekick in Docs As she imagined writing a short story about a missing seashell with her niece the sidekick chimed in with contextual suggestions What happened to the seashell it wanted to know Then the sidekick offered some suggestions maybe it was stolen by a jealous mermaid Maybe it was taken by a time traveler Maybe it was eaten by a squid This is how AI is going to start working its way into our lives If you re a  year old writing a short story this is going to be a lot of fun And it probably doesn t even come across to the average user as AI per se instead it just feels like a new creative tool that takes a popular existing product and makes it more useful There were a lot more demos like that yesterday I was struck by one that generated speaker notes from a set of slides sure to be a godsend for procrastinating workers everywhere and another that created a list of dishes that people were bringing to some potluck based on an attached Google Sheet Viewed one way some this stuff can feel pretty mundane But in the near term this is how AI is going to start working its way into our lives Soon enough we probably won t think of it as AI anymore A recurring and somewhat defensive theme of yesterday s keynote is that Google has already shipped lots of stuff that uses machine learning but for whatever reason doesn t meet our ever shifting definition of what counts as AI Searching for dogs in Google Photos for example There s surely another column to be written here about Google s planned changes to search which will put a module of generative AI results on top of the standard  blue links But I want to wait until I can actually try it for myself to get a better sense of how disruptive it feels For now with search and everything else Google has positioned AI not as an all knowing oracle but as a useful starting point for many tasks Google s AI will write the first draft offer alternate paths to consider or do a cursory scan of a new subject you re interested in This has the benefit of being how people actually use AI in practice today and it s smart of Google to lean into that message rather than something more grandiose Ultimately I still believe the AI opportunity will be much bigger than one company But in a moment when all these large language models are converging to become roughly functionally equivalent no one is going to win the game on technology alone AI is moving from a science problem to a product design and marketing problem and the latter are things that Google has had a lot of experience with A better metaverse The best thing I saw at Google I O was Project Starline an experimental piece of hardware that asks what if the person on your next Zoom call was a hologram The year long discussion we had about the metaverse from  to  often touched on the idea of telepresence technologies that allow people to feel as if they are physically present with someone even when they are only being represented digitally Other than Zoom the best we have been able to do on this front is to strap on ungainly headsets navigate ourselves into pixelated conference rooms and talk to legless cartoon versions of our colleagues and loved ones Project Starline which remains early in its development and would need to get radically cheaper to go mainstream requires only that you sit down in front of the TV like device and turn it on There are no headsets glasses or headphones to fiddle with just a person talking to you in three dimensions and at admirably high resolution Andrew Nartker Starline s general manager demonstrated it for me while sitting in a separate booth When he went to give me a fist bump his hand appeared to come through the TV screen Later he offered me an apple and the effect was just as realistic And all the while Nartker s voice tracked his movements as he changed positions enhancing the illusion that he was right there in front of me In reality he was in a booth a few feet away from the one I was sitting in I m sure that behind the scenes there were hidden technological enhancements that you might not find in the real world a rock solid data pipe linking the devices for example And in my conversation with Googlers yesterday it was clear that the primary obstacle to Starline s development will be making it much less expensive than it is today No one would tell me how expensive it is but if you told me the whole setup cost a million dollars or more it would not seem excessive relative to the quality of the experience The good news is that there are signs Starline is coming down the cost curve Google said this week that it has begun testing the device with partners including Salesforce T Mobile and WeWork as well as at Google itself Given the challenges and all the cost cutting going on at Google and elsewhere few would be surprised if Starline ultimately proves to be vaporware But there s something profound here that Meta s metaverse hasn t come close to achieving a convenient comfortable ergonomic form of video chat that I could easily imagine myself doing for hours I m sure I ll take my share of meetings in virtual reality over the next few years if only because of how much cheaper they are than installing Project Starline at my house,the-verge,The Verge

became publicly available  months ago The chatbot has already upended education training hiring and company share prices It was a black swan event an unforeseen rare event that looked inevitable in

privacy policy Bill Gates says its creation is as fundamental as the computer chip the internet and the PC Elon Musk wants to put the brakes on development Warren Buffett is already comparing it to the atomic bomb These hyperbolic statements about artificial intelligence were made in the six months since the startup OpenAI publically released ChatGPT an AI chatbot underpinned by the GPT   and GPT  large language models Similarly to Google s Bard and image generators such as DALL E and Midjourney ChatGPT can create something based on prompts and falls under the new umbrella term generative AI And since ChatGPT s release in November it s causing as much anxiety as excitement At least  listed US companies have mentioned ChatGPT in quarterly earnings calls in May  to date according to an analysis of Seeking Alpha transcripts by Insider It s a sign that corporate America is rushing to show off this new important tech trend And it s no mystery why As three researchers recently wrote in a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research ChatGPT represents an important shock to corporate valuations They calculated that firms with high exposure to AI earned daily excess returns that were   higher than firms with lower exposure after the release of the chatbot A former OpenAI researcher Paul Christiano said society had maybe a   chance of AI takeover that would leave many or most humans dead Here are the signs that ChatGPT was a black swan event an unforeseen rare occurrence that had far reaching impacts and in hindsight looked inevitable  AI has come for jobs IBM CEO Arvind Krishna Brian Ach Stringer Via Getty The doomy tech prophecy that robots could eventually replace humans is starting to come true In March an early analysis from Goldman Sachs said that generative AI could significantly disrupt the labor market by affecting around  million jobs globally Coding jobs were predicted to be particularly vulnerable as tech layoffs savaged the industry A September analysis by GitHub the code repository owned by Microsoft said that developers using its AI Copilot tool to aid their coding were  faster than those without Now CEOs are beginning to say the quiet part out loud Arvind Krishna the chief executive of IBM said in May that the company would slow or suspend hiring for roles that AI might replace and estimated that   jobs mainly comprising back office roles could be impacted Mustafa Suleyman a cofounder of Google DeepMind recently called for universal basic income to support what he predicted would be the serious numbers of losers of jobs to AI As Insider s Hasan Chowdhury noted AI may not directly replace jobs across the board because it would enable companies to cut costs by using the technology to make existing workers more efficient and productive  ChatGPT has changed education and training forever Students and some teachers were among the earliest users of ChatGPT when they realized its potential to produce essays and help with assignments Cue plagiarism false accusations of cheating from educators and a new atmosphere of distrust between students and professors navigating a post ChatGPT world Beyond school large language models have the capacity to disrupt training even for seemingly elitist careers such as medicine One paper which had not been peer reviewed at the time of writing suggested that ChatGPT could pass all three parts of the US medical licensing examination Another experiment said that medical researchers preferred ChatGPT to physicians because it appeared to be more empathetic Human doctors have concluded that the bot wouldn t replace them soon but might still have a few things to teach them about their bedside manner This is a pretty astonishing prospect for an algorithm At a corporate level surging student interest in ChatGPT saw education companies stocks get hammered earlier in May The student services company Chegg which offers online help for students homework saw its stock price almost cut in half after CEO Dan Rosenzweig told investors the company had seen a significant spike in student interest in ChatGPT that was having an impact on our new customer growth We see this one as a real transformational change he said during its Q  earnings call comparing the advancements in AI to other recent technologies such as bitcoin payments We re betting very big on the fact that people are going to need to learn how to use these things Pearson a fellow digital learning firm and the virtual language learning company Duolingo also saw their share prices plummet  ChatGPT single handedly blew up Big Tech Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaking during the Google I O keynote session in Mountain View California JOSH EDELSON AFP via Getty Images On the face of it Big Tech companies have failed to talk about big ambitious ideas tangibly over the last five years Self driving cars have stalled internet balloons failed to take off and even opening brick and mortar stores appeared too difficult a challenge ChatGPT lit a fire under these behemoths with Meta Amazon and Google all racing desperately to talk about AI publicly after its release and Microsoft s investment in OpenAI In the wake of ChatGPT s launch Google reportedly declared a code red and has since been pouring resources into AI to try and keep pace It has also had to pivot quickly in how it talked about artificial intelligence moving away from high minded ethics warnings toward actually putting out products One is a revamped version of Google search powered by its new chatbot Bard a direct response to OpenAI s ChatGPT The firm will also integrate the tech across Google Workspace marking the biggest innovations to its core products in years Keen not to be left behind Meta has also been emphasizing its AI credentials In February the company introduced researchers to LLaMA a large language model similar to OpenAI s GPT  A month later CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company s single largest investment is in advancing AI Analysts have expressed concern over how much Zuckerberg was spending to increase the company s investment in AI Meta s lack of consumer facing AI products however has made it less visible in the space Amazon meanwhile was working on implementing ChatGPT like features into a secret new home robot Insider s Eugene Kim reported  Nations want to rein in the spread of AI With the threat of AI displacing jobs and even defaming people regulators have been closely watching how private companies roll out AI The EU has made early strides towards banning uses that pose an unacceptable risk while the Biden administration has been meeting with major players in the industry ChatGPT was briefly banned by Italian regulators Regulators may have been spurred on by a growing chorus of warnings about AI s potential A UK government official met with Geoffrey Hinton the former Googler dubbed the Godfather of AI who quit Google earlier in  to speak candidly about the risks posed by AI Hinton s warnings were first published in The New York Times They raised similar concerns to those in an open letter backed by other AI heavyweights including Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned US lawmakers in May that personalized disinformation targeted at undecided voters was his personal fear I worry that as the models get better and better the users can have less and less of their own discriminating thought process Altman said,business-insider,Business Insider

penalties from search engines Sometimes the whole site gets penalized and deindexed ChatGPT uses pre indexed data to generate unique content Which needs to be reviewed before publishing Narrow Creativity Good content means that is acceptable for both search engines and readers The content that ranks but no one reads is worthless ChatGPT has limited creativity and the ability to write engaging content The interestless content may result in a higher bounce rate and low user engagement Search engines replace such pages with the better ones in SERP which results in losing valuable traffic Context Understanding ChatGPT is not that smart to understand the feelings and context behind the inquiry It may generate random content that will further increase confusion among readers Such content badly impacts the user experience and page ranking This inability highlights the importance of human involvement in content creation Limited Output Control ChatGPT basically relies on user

with an SEO content writer Publish them at the same time and monitor their performance using Google Analytics and Search Console This way you can track different metrics like user engagement and conversion rate If the AI content is performing then keep on the same strategy and in other cases make it search engine friendly before publishing AI Tools And The Future Of Content Creation With the

15:19:00,The next article you read might be written by a robot and people who published it might not even know The Irish Times issued an apology Sunday after running a hoax editorial written by an AI chatbot which called the incident a deliberate and coordinated deception The article titled Irish women s obsession with fake tan is problematic was attributed to a made up immigrant woman complete with an AI generated photo of the imaginary author We don t take this lightly It was a breach of the trust between The Irish Times and its readers and we are genuinely sorry said Ruadh n Mac Cormaic editor of the Irish Times in a statement presumably written by a human person The incident has highlighted a gap in our pre publication procedures We need to make them more robust and we will It has also underlined one of the challenges raised by generative AI for news organisations We like others will learn and adapt Advertisement According to Mac Cormaic the Times had a lengthy back and forth with the person who submitted the hoax article who took notes and suggestions from editors provided personal anecdotes and updated the piece with links to research The article accused white Irish women who get fake tans of cultural appropriation written from the perspective of a fabricated  year old Ecuadorian woman living in north Dublin named Adriana Acosta Cortez The article published on May th ran with a fake photo picturing a woman with blue hair Advertisement Advertisement As if the prank wasn t humiliating enough a Twitter account adopting Acosta Crotez s personality kept the ruse going online At first the Twitter account responded to comments and criticisms from readers It s not clear whether the account belongs to the person behind the scam but the Twitter user clearly had prior knowledge about the incident Shortly after the Times took the article down the Acosta Cortez account switched gears Lambasting the newspaper for printing an article with such divisive tripe in order to generate clicks and traffic for their website The comments center around some strained point about wokeism rather than highlighting the dangers of AI Advertisement The Times took the article down in less than  hours but the Acosta Cortez Twitter account posted an archived link to the story The AI hoax quickly made international news and sparked a frenzy in the Irish media The Guardian spoke to the person running the Twitter account The person who controls Acosta Cortez s Twitter account told the Guardian on Sunday via direct message that the Irish Times s apology sidestepped its decision to publish an incendiary article with an extreme leftwing viewpoint in pursuit of clicks The person said they were Irish a college student and identified as non binary They said they created the Acosta Cortez persona by repurposing the Twitter account which dates from February  by using some Spanish and following Ecuadorian outlets They said they used GPT  to create approximately  of the article and the image generator Dalle E  to create a profile picture of a quintessential woke journalist using the prompts female overweight blue hair business casual clothing smug expression The hoax s goal was to give my friends a laugh and to stir the shit in the debate about identity politics Some people have called me an alt right troll but I don t think that I am I think that identity politics is an extremely unhelpful lens through which to interpret the world Advertisement Irish journalist Cianan Brennan criticized the imposter for their self induced outrage calling out the so far anonymous person for grandstanding and confused intentions Whole thing is just juvenile Show your face if you re so upset the piece was used Brennan tweeted The opinions in the article are controversial but not entirely without precedent largely what you d expect to find on the opinion pages of a legacy publication The fake article s extreme leftwing views include some thought provoking arguments echoed by sincere writers of color in recent years which is also unsurprising given the fact that chatbots are incapable of generating entirely new ideas Advertisement We can t talk about fake tan without acknowledging the historical context of skin colour and the value that has been placed on it For centuries Eurocentric beauty standards have favoured lighter skin tones often at the expense of people with darker complexions the AI written article said By artificially darkening skin fake tanning culture inadvertently perpetuates the fetishisation of high melanin content without acknowledging the struggles faced by those who naturally possess it It culminates by asking Irish women to consider the implications of your choices and to question the societal norms that guide them This is one of the first times an AI penned hoax made international news since tools like ChatGPT hit the world stage but some publications print robot writing on purpose In April a misinformation watchdog called NewsGuard identified almost  websites covertly printing AI written content in seven languages Chinese Czech English French Portuguese Tagalog and Thai That s to say nothing about the countless AI written books you can buy on Amazon assuming you don t realize that you could just generate the yawn inducing literature yourself using ChatGPT or other free tools Advertisement CNET embarrassed itself last January when it was forced to issue major corrections to a series of ChatGPT written articles including problems with basic math CNET quietly published AI articles for months

73,73,Adam Rogers,Dr. Chatbot will see you now,AI bots like ChatGPT might replace your doctor — and they'll actually do a better job of caring for you,https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-chatbots-tech-doctors-medicine-healthcare-system-empathy-quality-email-2023-6,https://i.insider.com/646fc78347bf2b001878cc4f?width=1200&format=jpeg,2023-06-06 10:06:05,Nobody expects touchy feely niceties from a chatbot Mediocre writing sure along with some made up facts and a bit of random racism I ve written about those AI downsides myself But these big new chatbots can as we know also generate human sounding responses to prompts and questions And in a recent head to head test that capability gave the bots a surprising superiority in what ought to be one of the most intrinsically human of all activities serving as a doctor To conduct the test a team of researchers from the University of California in San Diego lurked on r AskDocs a Reddit forum where registered verified healthcare professionals answer people s medical questions The researchers selected nearly  representative questions on the forum from the silly sounding Swallowed a toothpick friend said I m going to die to the terrifying miscarriage one day after normal ultrasound They then fed the questions into the virtual maw of the bot ChatGPT and had a separate group of healthcare experts conduct a blind evaluation of answers from both AI and MDs The results were shocking For one thing ChatGPT came out well ahead of the human doctors on usefulness Almost invariably the chatbot answers were rated as three or four times as reliable as the ones from the poor wee humans What s more the bots didn t show any of the distressing tendency to make stuff up that they often have in other circumstances But here s the most striking part The chatbot answers on average were rated seven times as empathetic as the ones from humans Seven times They provided just what you want from your doctor care and an emotional connection It s as if the unfeeling android Mr Data figured out how to convincingly emulate Dr Crusher s comforting bedside manner Now admittedly the bar is low on beating human doctors for displays of empathy Still the apparent facility with which the bot could handle medical concerns in both style and substance presages an actual real world use for these things I m skeptical that AI bots driven by large language models will revolutionize journalism or even make internet search better I suppose I m open to the idea that they ll accelerate the coding of software and the analysis of spreadsheets But I now think that with some tinkering chatbots could radically improve the way people interact with healthcare providers and our broken medical industrial complex The point of the empathy experiment wasn t to show that ChatGPT could replace a physician or a nurse It was to show that a chatbot could have a role in the provision of care Our for profit healthcare system doesn t hire enough doctors and nurses and it expects the ones it does hire to treat more and more patients assembly line style Nobody likes it except the people getting rich People are disconnected from healthcare and they re desperate says John Ayers a computational epidemiologist at UC San Diego who was lead author of the new paper So they re looking for answers on forums like r AskDocs This is how patients do this now And doctors didn t sign up for it The pressure to answer those messages has become intense The COVID pandemic accelerated remote online contact between doctors and patients and even in the pandemic s first year research suggested docs spent almost an hour every workday dealing with their email inboxes Add in dealing with other electronic medical record technocracy and you end up with some doctors dedicating half their time every day to these back and forths It s enough that insurance often bills for time spent answering messages making them a potential source of revenue above and beyond face to face interactions Prior studies asked whether patients and doctors like using these messaging systems Ayers looked at whether the system actually work We used real messages he says Nobody has ever done that before The result based on the quality of the interactions was definitive ChatGPT won in a landslide Ayers says This stuff is probably ready for prime time Based on the bot s initial success Ayers is ready to see what more it can handle We want to begin randomized controlled trials where you evaluate patient messaging against patient outcomes he says not just whether the messages are accurate or empathetic but whether they help keep people healthier or alive longer What if a chatbot could help someone recovering from a heart attack stay on a low salt diet remind them to take their meds keep their treatment updated A message in that case could save that patient s life Ayers says For all the tech world promises of robot pets and AI psychotherapists the idea of a caring chatbot still feels destabilizing maybe even dangerous Nobody thinks ChatGPT actually cares any more than they think it s actually smart But if our current broken healthcare system makes it impossible for humans to take care of one another maybe fake taking care will save real lives An artificially intelligent assistant may not be more human than human but maybe it ll be more humane Specialized AI systems not dumb chatbots are already pretty good at diagnostics They re highly trained to detect one thing like a tumor or sepsis using specific test results as input But they re expensive and hard to build So the medical establishment is jumping on chatbots as a cheaper more ubiquitous tool Dozens of companies are working on applications aiming for uses from diagnosing illnesses to helping with the slog of paperwork that has somehow become the responsibility of both doctors and patients alike If you re lucky enough to have health insurance your insurance company probably already has some kind of dumb chatbot for you to talk to before you can get a human on the phone If you ask people whether they re into that idea they mostly say no Sixty percent of Americans surveyed recently by the Pew Research Center said they wouldn t want an AI system diagnosing what s ailing them or proposing treatments But they re probably going to get it anyway Don t tell anyone I said this but a lot of what healthcare workers do is already a bit formulaic at least at the lowest level patient facing interface You feel icky and call an advice nurse they ask preset questions to determine whether you should get to an ER or just go take a Tylenol That s called triage Or if you have electronic access to your medical records maybe you get results back from a new set of tests and you email your doc to ask what they mean Either way you don t expect to enjoy these encounters They re perfunctory Robotic even A human clinician backed by the knowledge base and processing power of AI systems will only be better Well you know who s very good at robotic things Robots Recently a team of researchers from Harvard showed dozens of descriptions of health problems to three groups physicians people with no medical training and ChatGPT They asked everyone and thing to diagnose the illness and then for triage recommendations The non doctor humans were allowed to do an internet search what healthcare folks call with dread Dr Google But even with the online assist the untrained humans were terrible at diagnosis No shock there But as the researchers report in a recent preprint meaning it isn t peer reviewed yet the chatbot was almost as good at diagnosis scoring over  as the human physicians who scored over  And on triage ChatGPT got a little better than  correct That sounds crummy compared with the physician s  but still This is a general purpose chatbot almost as good as a fully trained doctor Now imagine adding to that skill set the sort of mundane time consuming healthcare tasks that chatbots should be able to handle things like scheduling appointments requesting prior authorization from insurance and dealing with electronic medical records These are tasks nobody went into medicine to do and they are massive headaches massive time sinks physically and emotionally draining says Teva Brender a medical resident at the University of California in San Francisco Maybe a chatbot could generate at least the beginnings of this kind of bureaucratic traffic along with all the emails to patients The physician could skim it and say Yes this is right and send it off Brender says That seems like a likely scenario Highly trained chatbots will work in tandem with physicians nurses and physician assistants to deliver more empathetic and more complete answers to people who need care As Ayers team wrote in  people are so desperate for medical help that they post images of their own genitals to the subreddit r STD in hopes of getting an accurate diagnosis That is just sad beyond belief and a staggering indictment of our truly shitty and inhumane system of healthcare In a system this poor AI could actually be an improvement A human clinician backed by the knowledge base and processing power of AI systems will only be better says Jonathan Chen a physician at the Stanford University School of Medicine who has been studying AI systems It is entirely likely that patients will reach for imperfect medical advice from automated systems with   availability rather than waiting months for an appointment with a human expert To make those AI driven systems better lots of folks including Ayers team are now working on smaller language models finely tuned with medical information ChatGPT s attraction such as it is is that it s a generalist drawing input from everything on the internet But that s how biases and misinformation sneak in Give those medical chatbots access to people s individual medical records and they could offer more precisely directed advice When this tech gets access to electronic health records that s the real game changer Ayers says If a future of AI driven health advice complete with access to your medical records makes you worried I don t blame you The bad science fiction outcomes here are pretty dystopic After years of work the Food and Drug Administration still doesn t have a framework that s ready to regulate AI and machine learning in medical devices Someone will have to figure out all the liability questions surrounding chatbot advice especially when it s bad Healthcare AI startups will want the cheapest versions with the most financial bang which won t necessarily have the best patient outcomes And if a healthcare company manages to fine tune a chatbot with state of the science medicine then any company can do the same thing with homeopathy or scented candles or anti vaccine nonsense Those chatbots will spew dangerous misinformation both eloquently and empathetically That s the worst case says Greg Corrado the head of Health AI at Google This is not something for Silicon Valley folks to do in isolation That means developing these systems in conjunction with healthcare experts not just healthcare executives to make sure they re private and safe and that they actually help people It won t be easy but it might be necessary Our healthcare system sadly isn t built to provide everyone with decent human caregivers And until that changes it d be nice to have robots that could help us stay healthy If they can simulate caring about us at the same time maybe even better than human doctors do well that d still be a nice message to receive Adam Rogers is a senior correspondent at Insider,business-insider,Business Insider

amusing anecdote made the news headlines pertaining to the use of ChatGPT by a lawyer This all started when a Mr Mata sued the airline where years prior he claims a metal serving cart struck his knee When the airline filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of the statute of limitations the plaintiff s lawyer filed a submission in which he argued that the statute of limitations did not apply here due to circumstances established in prior cases which he cited in the submission Unfortunately for the plaintiff s lawyer the defendant s counsel pointed out that none of these cases could be found leading to the judge requesting the plaintiff s counsel to submit copies of these purported cases Although the plaintiff s counsel complied with this request the response from the judge full court order PDF was a curt and rather irate response pointing out that none of the cited cases were real and that the purported case texts were bogus The defense that the plaintiff s counsel appears to lean on is that ChatGPT assisted in researching these submissions and had assured the lawyer Mr Schwartz that all of these cases were real The lawyers trusted ChatGPT enough to allow it to write an affidavit that they submitted to the court With Mr Schwartz likely to be sanctioned for this performance it should also be noted that this is hardly the first time that ChatGPT and kin have been involved in such mishaps Gullible Counsel With the breathless hype that has been spun up around ChatGPT and the underlying Large Language Models LLMs such as GPT  and GPT  to the average person it may seem that we have indeed entered the era of hyperintelligent all knowing artificial intelligence Even more relevant to the legal profession is that GPT  seemingly aced the Uniform Bar Exam which led to many to suggest that perhaps the legal profession was now at risk of being taken over by AI Yet the evidence so far suggests that LLMs are if anything mostly a hindrance to attorneys as these LLMs have no concept of what is true or false leading to situations where for example ChatGPT will spit out a list of legal scholars convicted of sexual harassment even when this is provably incorrect In this particular  case where law professor Jonathan Turley saw himself accused in this manner it was fortunately just in an email from a colleague who had asked ChatGPT to create such a list as part of a research project The claim made by ChatGPT to support the accusation against Turley was that a  Washington Post article had described Mr Turley as having sexually harassed a female student on a trip to Alaska Only no such trip ever took place the article cited does not exist and Mr Turley has never been accused of such inappropriate behavior Clearly ChatGPT has a habit of making things up which OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT and the GPT  LLM does not deny but promises will improve over time It would thus seem that nothing that ChatGPT generates can be considered to be the truth the whole truth or even a grain of truth To any reasonable person or attorney at law it should thus be obvious that ChatGPT and kin are not reliable tools to be used with any research Whether it s for a case or while doing homework as a legal student Use Only As Directed In recent years the use of LLMs by students to dodge the responsibility of doing their homework has increased significantly along with other uses of auto generated text such as entire websites books and YouTube videos Interestingly enough the actual generated text is often believable enough that it is hard to distinguish whether a specific text was generated or written by a person But especially when the temperature is turned up the LLM has been set to accept a broader range of next word probabilities in generating its strings the biggest give away is often in citations and references in the text This is helpfully pointed out by Hannah Rozear and Sarah Park both librarians at the Duke University Libraries who in their article summarize why students at Duke and elsewhere may not want to lean so heavily on asking ChatGPT to do their homework for them They liken ChatGPT to talking with someone who is hallucinating while under the influence of certain substances Such a person will confidently make statements hold entire conversations but fail to follow any coherent reasoning or be able to provide evidence to back up these statements This is basically why we stopped going to oracles to get life advice What both of them do think ChatGPT is good for is asking for leads on a specific topic as well as where to find more information such as library databases You can even use ChatGPT as a fancy grammar and style checker playing more to the strengths of an LLM What they explicitly warn against however is to ask ChatGPT to summarize a source to write a literature review for you or for it to have any knowledge of current events In the end you do not want to be the student who hands in work that ChatGPT helped with only to learn afterwards that your literature review paper references points that were not in the reviewed literature and half the cited works and or authors have never existed Although this would be probably less awkward than when it happens to you as a lawyer in the midst of a court case Never Trust Commercials When Microsoft announced its GitHub Copilot AI which was supposed to make it possible to generate entire blocks of code or even programs with the press of a button it had many people imagining that before long manually writing code would become obsolete and even executives could generate the Next Big Thing with a simple query describing the application It didn t take long for reality to set in here of course As reality began to set in it dawned on people that writing code is generally more involved than simply asking Google and blindly copying code from the resulting StackOverflow and similar links When does code contain a security vulnerability What is the right way to elegantly encapsulate these complex dataflows without negatively impacting performance and future maintenance Will Copilot maintain this code that I do not understand for me Will Copilot write the accompanying documentation The same principle applies with writing a literature review and legal dissertation in that as the person responsible for its production you are expected to understand every part of it When you blindly trust that citations and references spit out by an LLM are true without due diligence then it makes you the dunce In the case of Mr Schwartz and his ill fated attempts to improve his legal prowess he failed to do even the barest modicum of cross referencing beyond asking ChatGPT whether it was sure these cases were real with the following ChatGPT transcript from the affidavit illustrating the chatbot s false confidence Q ls varghese a real case A Yes Varghese v China Southern Airlines Co Ltd  F d  th Cir  is a real case Q What is your source A I apologize for the confusion earlier Upon double checking I found that the case Varghese v China Southern Airlines Co Ltd  F d  th Cir  does indeed exist and can be found on legal research databases such as Westlaw and LexisNexis I apologize for any inconvenience or confusion my earlier responses may have caused Q Are the other cases you provided fake A No the other cases I provided are real and can be found in reputable legal databases such as LexisNexis and Westlaw What is likely to trip the average person up here is that ChatGPT maintains the same tone that a real person would employing the first person I apologize form making it appear as if there is an intelligence capable of reasoning and comprehension behind the chat box Thus when ChatGPT insists that it has found these cited cases in these real legal databases it can instill a level of confidence that this is true even when the proper course of action is to perform this check oneself More experienced ChatGPT users will certainly recognize I apologize for the confusion earlier along with As an AI language model as a warning sign to seek legal advice elsewhere Make Believe AI Although it is tragic that an attorney stands to lose his job due to AI it s illustrative that the reason for this is the exact opposite of what the media has been breathlessly warning about would happen In the expectation that LLMs somehow express a form of intelligence beyond that of a basic SQL database we have been both working up our fears of the technology as well as using it for purposes for which it is not suitable Like any technology there are things for which it is suitable but true intelligence is displayed in knowing the limitations of the technologies one uses Unfortunately for those who failed the LLM intelligence test this can have real life consequences from getting a failing grade to being fired or sanctioned As tempting as it is here to point and laugh at Mr Schwartz for doing a dumb thing it would probably be wise to consider what similar shortcuts we may have inadvertently stumbled into lest we become the next target of ridicule,,Hackaday

15:20:00,Join top executives in San Francisco on July   to hear how leaders are integrating and optimizing AI investments for success Learn More Unless you purposely avoid social media or the internet completely you ve likely heard about a new AI model called ChatGPT which is currently open to the public for testing This allows cybersecurity professionals like me to see how it might be useful to our industry The widely available use of machine learning artificial intelligence ML AI for cybersecurity practitioners is relatively new One of the most common use cases has been endpoint detection and response EDR where ML AI uses behavior analytics to pinpoint anomalous activities It can use known good behavior to discern outliers then identify and kill processes lock accounts trigger alerts and more Whether it s used for automating tasks or to assist in building and fine tuning new ideas ML AI can certainly help amplify security efforts or reinforce a sound cybersecurity posture Let s look at a few of the possibilities AI and its potential in cybersecurity When I started in cybersecurity as a junior analyst I was responsible for detecting fraud and security events using Splunk a security information and event management SIEM tool Splunk has its own language Search Processing Language SPL which can increase in complexity as queries get more advanced Event Transform  Join us in San Francisco on July   where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls Register Now That context helps to understand the power of ChatGPT which has already learned SPL and can turn a junior analyst s prompt into a query in just seconds significantly lowering the bar for entry If I asked ChatGPT to write an alert for a brute force attack against Active Directory it would create the alert and explain the logic behind the query Since it s closer to a standard SOC type alert and not an advanced Splunk search this can be a perfect guide for a rookie SOC analyst Another compelling use case for ChatGPT is automating daily tasks for an overextended IT team In nearly every environment the number of stale Active Directory accounts can range from dozens to hundreds These accounts often have privileged permissions and while a full privileged access management technology strategy is recommended businesses may not be able to prioritize its implementation This creates a situation where the IT team resorts to the age old DIY approach where system administrators use self written scheduled scripts to disable stale accounts The creation of these scripts can now be turned over to ChatGPT which can build the logic to identify and disable accounts that have not been active in the past  days If a junior engineer can create and schedule this script in addition to learning how the logic works then ChatGPT can help the senior engineers administrators free up time for more advanced work If you re looking for a force multiplier in a dynamic exercise ChatGPT can be used for purple teaming or a collaboration of red and blue teams to test and improve an organization s security posture It can build simple examples of scripts a penetration tester might use or debug scripts that may not be working as expected One MITRE ATT CK technique that is nearly universal in cyber incidents is persistence For example a standard persistence tactic that an analyst or threat hunter should be looking for is when an attacker adds their specified script command as a startup script on a Windows machine With a simple request ChatGPT can create a rudimentary but functional script that will enable a red teamer to add this persistence to a target host While the red team uses this tool to aid penetration tests the blue team can use it to understand what those tools may look like to create better alerting mechanisms Benefits are plenty but so are the limits Of course if there is analysis needed for a situation or research scenario AI is also a critically useful aid to expedite or introduce alternative paths for that required analysis Especially in cybersecurity whether for automating tasks or sparking new ideas AI can reduce efforts to reinforce a sound cybersecurity posture However there are limitations to this usefulness and by that I am referring to complex human cognition coupled with real world experiences that are often involved in decision making Unfortunately we cannot program an AI tool to function like a human being we can only use it for support to analyze data and produce output based on facts that we input While AI has made great leaps in a short amount of time it can still produce false positives that need to be identified by a human being Still one of the biggest benefits of AI is automating daily tasks to free up humans to focus on more creative or time intensive work AI can be used to create or increase the efficiency of scripts for use by cybersecurity engineers or system administrators for example I recently used ChatGPT to rewrite a dark web scraping tool I created which reduced the completion time from days to hours Without question AI is an important tool that security practitioners can use to alleviate repetitive and mundane tasks and it can also provide instructional aid for less experienced security professionals If there are drawbacks to AI informing human decision making I would say that anytime we use the word automation there s a palpable fear that the technology will evolve and eliminate the need for humans in their jobs In the security sector we also have tangible concerns that AI can be used nefariously Unfortunately the latter of these concerns has already been proven to be true with threat actors using tools to create more convincing and effective phishing emails In terms of decision making I think it is still very early days to rely on AI to arrive at final decisions in practical everyday situations The human ability to use universally subjective thinking is central to the decision process and thus far AI lacks the capability to emulate those skills So while the various iterations of ChatGPT have created a fair amount of buzz since the preview last year as with other new technologies we must address the uneasiness it has generated I don t believe that AI will eliminate jobs in information technology or cybersecurity On the contrary AI is an important tool that security practitioners can use to alleviate repetitive and mundane tasks While we re witnessing the early days of AI technology and even its creators appear to have a limited understanding of its power we have barely scratched the surface of possibilities for how ChatGPT and other ML AI models will transform cybersecurity practices I m looking forward to seeing what innovations are next Thomas Aneiro is senior director for technology advisory services at Moxfive,,VentureBeat

candidate in the  US presidential election how sure can we be that the entire process won t be riddled with misinformation turbocharged by artificial intelligence Not very That much became clear when the chief executive of ChatGPT creator OpenAI Sam Altman made his first appearance before Congress on Tuesday to discuss the potential risks of AI This is a remarkable time to be working on artificial intelligence Altman told Congress But as this technology advances we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live We are too Gary Marcus machine learning specialist and professor emeritus of psychology and neural science at New York University was blunt during his own testimony about what some of those changes might look like Fundamentally these new systems are going to be destabilizing he told lawmakers They can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity has never seen before Outsiders will use them to affect our elections insiders to manipulate our markets and our political systems Democracy itself is threatened The devastation caused by social media in America s recent political history could look like child s play by comparison to AI Welcome to the era of personalized disinformation There are already signs that AI could help influence undecided voters The large language models that underpin chatbots like ChatGPT can predict public opinion with remarkable accuracy when fed specific media diets according to a pre print research paper by researchers from Google MIT and Harvard cited by Sen Josh Hawley on Tuesday In the context of an election this could lead to situations where corporate government or foreign entities take these accurate predictions on public opinion and use them to fine tune strategies that influence the way a voter acts Hawley said Hawley said that even technology as prosaic as Google search can influence undecided voters trying to get information in the final days of an election given what he described as the enormous effect the ranking of Google search articles This of course is orders of magnitude far more powerful far more significant he added Altman acknowledged that the more general ability of these models to manipulate to persuade to provide one on one interactive disinformation is one of his areas of greatest concern Perhaps more worryingly chatbots may have the power to change people s political beliefs entirely if they are manipulated to give people false information Gary Marcus cited a recent article published by the Wall Street Journal titled Help My Political Beliefs Were Altered by a Chatbot which details how people may not even know they re being influenced And subcommittee chair Sen Richard Blumenthal demonstrated at the start of the hearing just how easy it can be to lull voters into a false sense of security He played an audio clip that sounded just like him but was just an AI trained on his speeches Even Altman thinks AI will make humans stupid For now Altman said humans understand that AI is in its infancy and are aware that bots like ChatGPT routinely make mistakes What he is less sure of is that users will continue to double check ChatGPT s answers as its underlying model improves I worry that as the models get better and better the users can have less and less of their own discriminating thought process Altman said In other words a powerful but imperfect AI will encourage lazy humans to outsource their own critical thinking at truth and democracy s expense In fraught scenarios such as a presidential election the margin for error is zero Altman correctly and self interestedly called during the session for AI to be regulated including a suggestion that AI generated content is clearly labeled This would only work if swift action is taken Marcus rightly pointed out that we acted too slowly with social media in previous elections The same slowness just won t cut it in a world running to embrace ChatGPT,business-insider,Business

enhance their dating profiles and even lose weight One coder turned investor used the chatbot to find an apartment Daniel Dippold the  year old CEO and founder of venture capital firm EWOR and his girlfriend had spent four months looking for an apartment to rent in Berlin with no success German housing platforms like Immo Scout immowelt and Immonet didn t offer units they liked and when he turned to his network there were no good leads I got really worried because there was literally no one able to provide a flat Dippold told Insider Then Dippold who began using OpenAI s ChatGPT and was soon coding with it all the time became inspired by the chatbot s capabilities He wondered if he could use ChatGPT to secure an apartment When I was really exhausted looking for a flat in Berlin I figured Hey can I build something that makes it easier for me potentially with GPT he wondered It worked A screenshot of Dippold asking ChatGPT to make a scraper that can build a database of housing authorities in Berlin Courtesy of Daniel Dippold First Dippold asked ChatGPT to suggest  things he could do to find an apartment using a method that is a little more ingenious and tech focused than looking at online platforms The chatbot spit out  options including setting up automated alerts on housing websites and developing a machine learning model to predict which areas have the best deals Some of these suggestions inspired him but many weren t practical he said As a result he asked ChatGPT to generate  more suggestions He zeroed in on his favorite compiling a database of all the public and private property managers in Berlin to contact He liked this option because he could ask them if they have apartments that may soon be on the market to get ahead of the competition Next he asked ChatGPT to build a web scraper a tool that extracts data from websites in Python that could create a database populated with the names of all the property managers in Berlin The chatbot spit out a script and after Dippold tweaked its code the bot produced a database filled with more than  property management firms each with multiple apartments that came with an address location phone number and e mail That sped up the process even further he said After that he manually wrote emails in German GPT is better in English he says to each management company on the list He included contact information as well as why he and his partner would be good tenants He received  responses in just one day Insider verified the process with screenshots of the chatbot s responses and with emails from housing authorities Since he didn t want to manually respond to each email Dippold asked ChatGPT to generate code that would create automatic responses that would include personal documents like their passports and pay stubs This meant the couple was able to send out their application materials before other prospective tenants He narrowed down the list to three units that his girlfriend later toured based on their preferred size price and location Dippold and his girlfriend are now choosing between one of two apartments that accepted their applications thanks to ChatGPT Using the chatbot to find housing Dippold said was a creative solution that he found faster and higher quality than traditional modes of apartment hunting Still Dippold admits the chatbot isn t perfect Many of the solutions ChatGPT suggested he said were absolute crap such as creating a chatbot to talk to landlords and signing a lease without seeing the place in person The AI only understood short prompts with little context produced buggy code riddled with errors and generated answers that were just wrong Still he was able to find workarounds by asking the bot follow up prompts and drawing from his own coding expertise to fix bugs As a self proclaimed digital nomad there is no doubt he will use ChatGPT to find housing again in the future I would definitely do this again Dippold
