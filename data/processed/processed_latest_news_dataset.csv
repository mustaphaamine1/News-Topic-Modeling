hidden granular features NASA s Parker Solar Probe PSP has flown close enough to the sun to detect the fine structure of the solar wind close to where it is generated at the sun s surface revealing details that are lost as the wind exits the corona as a uniform blast of charged particles It s like seeing jets of water emanating from a showerhead through the blast of water hitting you in the face In a paper published on June  in the journal Nature a team of scientists led by Stuart D Bale a professor of physics at the University of California Berkeley and James Drake of the University of Maryland College Park report that PSP has detected streams of high energy particles that match the supergranulation flows within coronal holes which suggests that these are the regions where the so called fast solar wind originates Coronal holes are areas where magnetic field lines emerge from the surface without looping back inward thus forming open field lines that expand outward and fill most of space around the sun These holes are usually at the poles during the sun s quiet periods so the fast solar wind they generate doesn t hit Earth But when the sun becomes active every  years as its magnetic field flips these holes appear all over the surface generating bursts of solar wind aimed directly at Earth Understanding how and where the solar wind originates will help predict solar storms that while producing beautiful auroras on Earth can also wreak havoc with satellites and the electrical grid Winds carry lots of information from the sun to Earth so understanding the mechanism behind the sun s wind is important for practical reasons on Earth Drake said That s going to affect our ability to understand how the sun releases energy and drives geomagnetic storms which are a threat to our communication networks Based on the team s analysis the coronal holes are like showerheads with roughly evenly spaced jets emerging from bright spots where magnetic field lines funnel into and out of the surface of the sun The scientists argue that when oppositely directed magnetic fields pass one another in these funnels which can be   miles across the fields often break and reconnect slinging charged particles out of the sun The photosphere is covered by convection cells like in a boiling pot of water and the larger scale convection flow is called supergranulation Bale said Where these supergranulation cells meet and go downward they drag the magnetic field in their path into this downward kind of funnel The magnetic field becomes very intensified there because it s just jammed It s kind of a scoop of magnetic field going down into a drain And the spatial separation of those little drains those funnels is what we re seeing now with solar probe data Based on the presence of some extremely high energy particles that PSP has detected particles traveling  to  times faster than the solar wind average the researchers conclude that the wind could only be made by this process which is called magnetic reconnection The PSP was launched in  primarily to resolve two conflicting explanations for the origin of the high energy particles that comprise the solar wind magnetic reconnection or acceleration by plasma or Alfv n waves The big conclusion is that it s magnetic reconnection within these funnel structures that s providing the energy source of the fast solar wind Bale said It doesn t just come from everywhere in a coronal hole it s substructured within coronal holes to these supergranulation cells It comes from these little bundles of magnetic energy that are associated with the convection flows Our results we think are strong evidence that it s reconnection that s doing that The funnel structures likely correspond to the bright jetlets that can be seen from Earth within coronal holes as reported recently by Nour Raouafi a co author of the study and the Parker Solar Probe project scientist at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University APL designed built manages and operates the spacecraft Plunging into the sun By the time the solar wind reaches Earth  million miles from the sun it has evolved into a homogeneous turbulent flow of roiling magnetic fields intertwined with charged particles that interact with Earth s own magnetic field and dump electrical energy into the upper atmosphere This excites atoms producing colorful auroras at the poles but has effects that trickle down into Earth s atmosphere Predicting the most intense winds called solar storms and their near Earth consequences is one mission of NASA s Living With a Star program which funded PSP The probe was designed to determine what this turbulent wind looks like where it s generated near the sun s surface or photosphere and how the wind s charged particles protons electrons and heavier ions primarily helium nuclei are accelerated to escape the sun s gravity To do this PSP had to get closer than  to  solar radii that is closer than about  million miles Once you get below that altitude  or  solar radii or so there s a lot less evolution of the solar wind and it s more structured you see more of the imprints of what was on the sun Bale said In  PSP s instruments recorded magnetic field switchbacks in the Alfv n waves that seemed to be associated with the regions where the solar wind is generated By the time the probe reached about  solar radii from the surface of the sun   million miles the data were clear that the probe was passing through jets of material rather than mere turbulence Bale Drake and their colleagues traced these jets back to the supergranulation cells in the photosphere where magnetic fields bunch up and funnel into the sun But were the charged particles being accelerated in these funnels by magnetic reconnection which would slingshot particles outward or by waves of hot plasma ionized particles and magnetic field streaming out of the sun as if they re surfing a wave The fact that PSP detected extremely high energy particles in these jets tens to hundreds of kiloelectron volts keV versus a few keV for most solar wind particles told Bale that it has to be magnetic reconnection that accelerates the particles and generates the Alfv n waves which likely give the particles an extra boost Our interpretation is that these jets of reconnection outflow excite Alfv n waves as they propagate out Bale said That s an observation that s well known from Earth s magnetotail as well where you have similar kinds of processes I don t understand how wave damping can produce these hot particles up to hundreds of keV whereas it comes naturally out of the reconnection process And we see it in our simulations too The PSP won t be able to get any closer to the sun than about   solar radii above the surface about  million miles without frying its instruments Bale expects to solidify the team s conclusions with data from that altitude though the sun is now entering solar maximum when activity becomes much more chaotic and may obscure the processes the scientists are trying to view There was some consternation at the beginning of the solar probe mission that we re going to launch this thing right into the quietest most dull part of the solar cycle Bale said But I think without that we would never have understood this It would have been just too messy I think we re lucky that we launched it in the solar minimum Reference Interchange reconnection as the source of the fast solar wind within coronal holes by S D Bale J F Drake M D McManus M I Desai S T Badman D

the summer transfer window opens on July th this will be a monumental move for the Herons who are at the bottom of the Eastern Conference table Messi will have to take one of their three Designated Player tags upon joining the club which will require some roster mechanics since Josef Martinez Rodolfo Pizarro and Gregore occupy those three slots but the club will find a way to make things happen

for Miami to swing for the fences Tata Martino is someone who has been linked to join but the line of managers who would want to come with Messi as a member of the club is longer than you can count The pressure will be high as whoever leads the side will be expected to bring results from the first day and the magnifying glass on the club couldn t be larger once Messi steps on the pitch There are things to like about the roster as Leonardo Campana and Martinez are a great strike force and they ll have Messi supporting them but while that helps the attack one thing that it doesn t help is that this team has conceded  goals in  games played This isn t a terrible number but with the team getting heavier in attack and then needing to shed players to make funds work they ll need to be careful not to neglect the defensive side of the ball But while they ll be shedding players others like Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez are targets that the team can add during the summer What Miami looks like now and what the team will look like when the transfer window opens on July th are two very different things The anticipation for the clubs performance when Messi gets on the field is already showing as a team that was   to win the title only yesterday is currently at   and falling With additions subtractions and the integration of Messi things are changing quickly in Miami What to expect While Messi is now  playmaking isn t something that dwindles quickly and as his vision is second to none in the world let alone in MLS and Campana and Martinez can do the running in front of him Fresh off of winning the World Cup and Ligue  Messi also grabbed  goals and  assists in domestic play The closest recent comparison to Messi s arrival might be Lorenzo Insigne s coming to Toronto from Napoli Messi has had similar topline attacking numbers Over his two seasons before coming Insigne scored  league goals and assisted  more while Messi scored  and assisted  Insigne plays in a different role which requires him to use his legs more but even with only  MLS appearances he has scored eight goals and assisted four Messi could genuinely hit those marks by the end of the season due to having better attacking talent around him and due to being Messi and not Insigne Miami are a club lacking in defense which could also change during the summer but there s a reason why the team is now among the contenders to win the league and that s because of one Lionel Messi Who even coaches Messi After moving on from Nevile all signs point to Martino coaching the team The Argentine manager has already won MLS Cup with Atlanta United and he has also coached Messi between   for the Argentina National team and Barcelona Despite Martino s struggles with the Mexican national team who crashed out of the  World Cup during the group stage he is still a highly regarded manager who could do wonders with this Miami team There are talented players but they also get to look ahead for who the team could sign to fill Martino s preferred formation A manager who can be flexible in his setups some semblance of a    or    may be best for Miami to get the best out of their attacking trident while also ensuring that there s a sound defense to flank them The defense has been the sole constant for the team with Drake Callender DeAndre Yedlin Franco Negri Serhiy Kryvtsov and Christopher McVey being the only players on the team to log more than  league minutes so far this season If Martino can find three players to start in the middle around them this team can quickly climb the ranks to become contenders It s important to remember that Inter Miami was a playoff team last season and with the right leadership they can get back there Listen below and follow In Soccer We Trust A CBS

that he doesn t have  league minutes and that Messi will presumably take his role that makes Pizzaro one of the more expendable players on the roster but it could be tricky to move him on during the summer to open that spot If that proves to be too tricky there is the option of trying to buy down Gregore s salary hit but that could dip into funds that Miami will need to make additional signings because while the team looks solid in attack and defense midfielders and depth and friends for Messi are needed Are Messi and friends even a good idea It s no secret that Messi would like his former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets to join him in making Miami resemble his Barcelona heyday as closely as possible Jordi Alaba and Luis Suarez are also names that have been mentioned but when considering what the team needs to win this could turn into a similar situation to NBA superstar LeBron James being a defacto general manager for the Los Angeles Lakers While all players have their wants and in some cases it s good to lean into those it s not always in the best interest for the team In the case of the Lakers some of the trades that they ve made to get players that James wants to play with aren t moves that ended up helping the team but elsewhere in the NBA the Milwaukee Bucks helped Giannis Antetokounmpo by adding his brother Thanasis Antetokoumpo to help him settle But there s a big differences between adding players to help with comfort off the field and adding players to help the team If Busquets comes to Miami to help Messi integrate then the move isn t an issue but playing as a lone central defensive midfielder in the Miami heat during the middle of summer things might not go too well MLS has a long history of eating aging midfielders who struggle with the pace of MLS even while being technically superior Just ask Steven Gerrard and Andrea Pirlo and we ve even seen Miami have issues with this at the striker position where Gonzalo Higuain needed to get into shape before figuring out the league In targeting aging players the team needs to be careful as they won t get many defensive contributions from the attackers If the Herons instead target talented young midfielders not only will they be hungry to perform supporting a player that they idolize but younger players will also be more affordably to fill out a roster A lot of work will need to be done but everything begins with naming a coach Having that in hand that coach can communicate with Messi and make sure that when he arrives the team is able to perform at the best level possible leaving the current side at the bottom of the Eastern Conference as a distant memory,,CBS Sports
9,9,,"20 MLB players whose Hall of Fame careers were derailed by injury, as Jacob deGrom faces another setback - CBS Sports","Will Jacob deGrom join the likes of Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Johan Santana and the rest of this list?",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/20-mlb-players-whose-hall-of-fame-careers-were-derailed-by-injury-as-jacob-degrom-faces-another-setback/,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/06/07/e32fce7d-92bf-4bbb-bda8-45193449a12f/thumbnail/1200x675/8ea197d6ef3ce1ad20282b738a0231f7/johanmattinglynomar-usatsi.png,2023-06-08 06:08:00,The season ending injury to Rangers ace Jacob deGrom already sent us down the path of examining how this impacts his Hall of Fame chances The overarching fear is he ends up on the same list of so many before him who had Hall of Fame talent but were derailed by injuries In fact let s take a look at some players on that list I ve compiled  who could well already be in Cooperstown or would otherwise be a lock to make it in the future if not for injuries Now this isn t an exhaustive list You won t find every single player who meets the subjective criteria nor will you find players who either should be in the Hall hello Kenny Lofton and Bobby Grich are out due to PED ties what up Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens or are all time Hall of the Very Good types hey Paul Konerko and Jimmy Rollins This is just a collection of players with whom it feels like deGrom will end up forever tied Some have better cases than others obviously as no two players are ever the same Also this will skew modern There s one player who goes back to the s and we ll see a few from the s but it s mostly more recent than that There are reasons for it most significantly that a much larger percentage of players from further back in history made the Hall of Fame and also injury data from further back is much harder to come by Plus the majority of the readership here will have memories of the players listed while no one actually remembers watching the s Anywho here are  players who fell short of the Hall of Fame directly due to injury issues Catcher Joe Mauer I threw the asterisk on there because I think Mauer is going to get in We ll start finding out this coming offseason If he doesn t make it though his issues with concussions will be mostly to blame Through his age  season he was a    hitter and had won an MVP I think he s going to make it anyway but the concussion issues have made it a discussion when it otherwise wouldn t have been Thurman Munson Here s the lone case on the list where it wasn t an injury but a tragic death The seven time All Star won an MVP and finished a career  hitter with a  OPS and two rings He sits th in catcher JAWS all time Munson spent  years on the Hall of Fame ballot never getting above   percent of the vote First base Don Mattingly Donnie Baseball was ruined by back injuries Through his age  season he was a  hitter with a  OPS He had an MVP and a runner up and two other top seven finishes He led the league in doubles three times hits twice RBI once and won a batting title He spent  years on the BBWAA ballot and has been in vet committees since then but hasn t gotten in Will Clark Through his age  season Will the Thrill was a career     OPS hitter with four top five finishes in MVP voting A series of injuries held him back the rest of the way He still finished above  by three points in average while compiling   hits and over   RBI but a fully healthy career likely has him in the Hall Second base Dustin Pedroia His first two full seasons with the Red Sox resulted in a Rookie of the Year World Series title and MVP He would tack on another ring and two more top  MVP finishes but Pedroia also finished his career with just eight seasons of more than  games He hasn t been on the Hall of Fame ballot yet but I seriously doubt he makes it in Given how relatively close he is we can blame the litany of injury woes he faced Third base David Wright Wright ended his career a     OPS hitter with an average of   WAR per  games Those types of rate stats at the still underrepresented position of third base would play in Cooperstown discussions Unfortunately what was left of his career after his age  season was injury marred He finished with   hits  doubles  homers  RBI and  runs Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra Through his age  season Nomah was a  hitter while averaging  doubles  homers  RBI and  runs per  games The rest of his career he only averaged  games played per season He got   percent of the vote his first try in the ballot but fell to just   percent the next cycle Troy Tulowitzki With Larry Walker in and Todd Helton headed that way a path could ve been cleared away from the Coors Field stigma to make room for Tulo but he just couldn t stay on the field enough He played in at least  games just three times and only played in  plus games eight times He still finished a  hitter with a  OPS and outstanding defense at short Outfield Albert Belle For various reasons Belle has actually turned into an underrated slugger A degenerative hip injury forced him into retirement after his age  season and ended his career with   hits  doubles  homers   RBI and  runs Those won t cut it for a corner outfielder designated hitter But man Belle could rake He slashed     OPS and led the league in RBI three times slugging twice and total bases three times He went over  RBI in every single season in which he qualified for the batting title and even drove home  in just  at bats in  Roger Maris Yes there were injuries namely impacting  and  but it s also difficult to tell what kind of toll the stress from the  home run chase took on Maris The two time MVP had a great peak but didn t make   career games That left all his counting stats short Dale Murphy Murphy won back to back MVPs in the early s He was an icon and through his age  season looked like he was en route to Cooperstown He already had   hits  homers and  RBI with a  OPS and five Gold Gloves Then a knee injury ruined him He finished with   hits  homers   RBI and a    slash Fred Lynn It wasn t really one thing in particular with Lynn He was just banged up seemingly all the time He played in at least  games just four times in his  years He was a nine time All Star with an MVP and some other huge seasons but finished with   hits  doubles   RBI and   runs Pitchers Johan Santana How amazing was Prime Johan Man he just felt like a Hall of Famer you know He won two Cy Youngs and finished third in voting twice He led the league in ERA three times innings twice strikeouts three times and WHIP four times I think he should be in the Hall regardless but he only made  starts all in one season after his age  season He fell  strikeouts shy of   and ended with just  wins Dave Stieb Back and shoulder injuries did Stieb in but he was an ace through the mid s From   he had a   ERA   WHIP  ERA and finished in the top seven of Cy Young voting three times The workhorse led the league in innings twice and complete games once He shows decently in JAWS to the point that getting those  wins over  and the   strikeouts over   could ve gone a long way in his Hall of Fame case Bret Saberhagan The two time Cy Young winner came up in  and was still pitching in the majors in  He only had five seasons at least  starts though He finished with  wins and   strikeouts to go with his   ERA  ERA and   WHIP Again imagine him with at least  wins and over   strikeouts and there could ve been different discussions Beyond that though more full seasons instead of partial could ve meant more All Star Game and hardware Orel Hershisher Hershiser was arguably the best pitcher in baseball in the late s finishing in the top four of Cy Young voting four times from   He led the league innings in the last three seasons in there and that took a toll on him He lost a good portion of the next two seasons to injury and was never the same Fernando Valenzuela Not so much injury as overuse as a youngster Fernando Mania was incredible in  He won Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Through his age  season he had  wins   strikeouts and a   ERA  ERA He also already had over   innings and  complete games The rest of his career was riddled with injuries and mediocrity Brandon Webb Webb was good from the start Then he was exceptional Then it was over He won the  Cy Young finished second in each of the next two seasons got hurt in his first start in  and that was it He was never in the majors again In  career starts with one appearance in relief he was   with a   ERA  ERA JR Richard Richard had basically five full seasons and then a half season of excellence He went over  strikeouts twice He finished in the top seven of Cy Young voting three times He led the majors in ERA in  and had a   ERA in  before having a stroke that ended his career at age  Stephen Strasburg We don t really need to review this one right As talented as anyone we ve seen his MLB career could be over He s made  starts He s gone   with   strikeouts in   innings He s a three time All Star with a World Series title and World Series MVP,,CBS Sports

often.",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-talk-is-war-even-putin-2023-06-08/,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/jxNbpWrQUZLsLMJAS97fWAlfLoo=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5MIAQITII5PARPILCKQKCKRPH4.jpg,2023-06-08 06:03:00,MOSCOW June  Reuters For more than  months Russia has been fighting a war in Ukraine that the Kremlin refused to call a war but that is changing President Vladimir Putin is using the word war more often When Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb  last year he called it a special military operation a euphemism the Kremlin Russian ministers and state media mostly stuck to even coining a new Russian acronym the SVO Calling the conflict a war was effectively outlawed for the Russian media by a series of very broad laws soon after the invasion The Russian media was ordered not to use the word war and has either complied or shut down But in response to what Russia said was a major Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow Putin last week used the word war four times in relation to Ukraine according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks No matter what we say they will always look to apportion the blame in Russia but this is not right we did not unleash this war I repeat in  the Kyiv regime unleashed war in the Donbas Putin said That remark was shown by Rossiya state television s most important Sunday slot Kremlin correspondent Pavel Zarubin told viewers that Putin was devoting significant amounts of time to the conflict behind the scenes The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in  after a pro Russian president was toppled in Ukraine s Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea with Russian backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine s armed forces On the May  Victory Day when Russians commemorate the Soviet Union s victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two Putin told veterans on Red Square A real war has been unleashed against our Motherland again In recent months Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Wagner mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin have all used the word war or voina in Russian in public We are basically living in the conditions of war said Vyacheslav Gladkov the governor of Russia s Belgorod region which has come under attack in recent weeks In private the Russian elite calls it a war The creeping acceptance of war even in public gives a sense of how the Kremlin s perceptions have changed and may give an taste of the future after more than  months of the most deadly war in Europe since World War Two It is striking just how Putin and the elite appear to be breaking their own rules said one Western diplomat in Moscow What is more important is what is says about the future does war mean a more serious approach and what will Russia at war look like WAR Euphemisms for war are nothing new U S President Lyndon B Johnson cast growing involvement in the Vietnam war as limited military action while the  U S invasion of Afghanistan was cast as Operation Enduring Freedom by U S President George W Bush When Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev triggered the  year Afghan Soviet war in  Moscow cast the invasion as an operation to provide international assistance to the friendly Afghan people You must remember and be aware that the SVO was invented at a time when they thought they would win quickly and bloodlessly like in the Crimea said Abbas Gallyamov a former Kremlin speech writer But now it is clear to everyone that this is a war And it became clear a long time ago when everyone realized that the blitzkrieg had failed Kremlin transcripts show Putin has recently repeatedly used the word in relation to what he says is an information and sanctions war unleashed by the West against Russia as well as blaming Ukraine for a conflict that is now spilling over Last year he used the term sparingly When he claimed four Ukrainian regions as parts of Russia in September he described the conflict as a war in October he said the West was inciting war and in December was even more explicit talking of this war That prompted Nikita Yuferev a councillor in St Petersburg to file a complaint It went nowhere Yuferev said along with complaints against the use of the word by other officials Sooner or later we are going to get to the point when everyone calls it a war and recognises it as a war Yuferev told Reuters And war can mean martial law the mobilisation of the economy mobilisation of the military and reservists RUSSIA AT WAR The Kremlin has said there is no plan for martial law or a further mobilisation after a limited one last year But Putin approved amendments last month allowing elections under martial law and defence companies have brought in extra shifts to work almost around the clock Attacks far inside Russia that Moscow blamed on Ukraine have stiffened opinion within the Kremlin emboldening hawks who propose a much tougher approach to a war in which Putin has said Russia has not got even got serious yet In Moscow the war is cast as existential and decorated with Russian Orthodox symbolism Russian mercenary Prigozhin who accuses Putin s top brass of ruining the Russian army raised the prospect of events unfolding as they did under the dictatorship of Chile s General Augusto Pinochet People write to me that we need to do a Chile to defend ourselves Chile that is a Pinochet Chile is the elite of Russia or above all the bureaucratic elite in a stadium surrounded by people with automatic weapons Prigozhin said This is not a game he said We are losing this war Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge editing by Philippa Fletcher

used to recover kidneys and other organs but not more fragile hearts Shawn Rocco Duke Health via AP WASHINGTON AP Most transplanted hearts are from donors who are brain dead but new research shows a different approach can be just as successful and boost the number of available organs It s called donation after circulatory death a method long used to recover kidneys and other organs but not more fragile hearts Duke Health researchers said Wednesday that using those long shunned hearts could allow possibly thousands more patients a chance at a lifesaving transplant expanding the number of donor hearts by  Honestly if we could snap our fingers and just get people to use this I think it probably would go up even more than that said transplant surgeon Dr Jacob Schroder of Duke University School of Medicine who led the research This really should be standard of care The usual method of organ donation occurs when doctors through careful testing determine someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury meaning they re brain dead The body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating and organs oxygenated until they re recovered and put on ice In contrast donation after circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn t yet ceased the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops That means organs go without oxygen for a while before they can be recovered and surgeons worried the heart would be damaged left it behind What s changed Now doctors can remove those hearts and put them in a machine that reanimates them pumping through blood and nutrients as they re transported and demonstrating if they work OK before the planned transplant Wednesday s study conducted at multiple hospitals around the country involved  transplant recipients half who received DCD hearts and half given hearts from brain dead donors that were transported on ice Survival six months later was about the same  for the recipients of cardiac death donations and  for those who got the usual hearts the researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine The findings are exciting and show the potential to increase fairness and equity in heart transplantation allowing more persons with heart failure to have access to this lifesaving therapy transplant cardiologist Dr Nancy Sweitzer of Washington University in St Louis who wasn t involved with the study wrote in an accompanying editorial Last year   heart transplants were performed in the U S a record number but not nearly enough to meet the need Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from advanced heart failure but many never are offered a transplant and still others die waiting for one Researchers in Australia and the U K first began trying DCD heart transplants about seven years ago Duke pioneered the U S experiments in late  one of about  U S hospitals now offering this method Last year there were  such heart transplants in the U S and  so far this year according to the United Network for Organ Sharing In the Duke led study nearly  of the DCD hearts recovered wound up being transplanted signaling that it s worthwhile for more hospitals to start using the newer method Sweitzer noted that many would be donors have severe brain injuries but don t meet the criteria for brain death meaning a lot of potentially usable hearts never get donated But she also cautioned that there s still more to learn noting that the very sickest patients on the waiting list were less likely to receive DCD hearts in the study Schroder said most who received DCD hearts already had implanted heart pumps that made the transplant more difficult to perform even if they weren t ranked as high on the waiting list The study was funded by TransMedics which makes the heart storage system The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute s Science and Educational Media Group The

03:08:00,Listen  min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share The executives of corporate America are stepping up efforts to get workers back into the office using a combination of threats and incentives to get employees to give up the work from home lifestyle they adopted in the first years of the covid  pandemic Wp Get the full experience Choose your plan ArrowRight For over a year Google has asked workers to come in three days a week luring them with free food and other perks But now the company is getting serious On Wednesday the company told workers that they must comply with the three day requirement or their nonattendance could show up on their performance reviews according to a memo sent to employees by Google Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi obtained by The Washington Post At Farmers Insurance many workers are being asked to return to offices three days a week starting in September even after they were told last year that remote work was here to stay In contrast tech giant Salesforce said it will donate to local charities for each day workers come in to the office later this month an attempt to appeal to workers altruistic impulses Advertisement Despite the pandemic being declared over by President Biden the tug of war over the office is still at a fever pitch Workers are reluctant to give up the flexibility they gained during the pandemic arguing it has benefited their mental health and work life balance But many executives are adamant the office is still a necessary nexus for innovation and collaboration and local governments are eager to see workers return to help revitalize struggling downtowns Perks like fancy coffee free lunches and commuter benefits that employers once used to lure workers back have vanished in most workplaces Big corporations like Disney Starbucks and AT T have mandated in recent months that workers return to offices Despite these efforts office occupancy remains stubbornly stuck below  percent of pre pandemic levels in major metropolitan areas around the country according to data tracked by Kastle Systems Now as a huge wave of layoffs continues in Silicon Valley and general economic unease persists across the country companies are making a renewed push and many of them aren t playing nice anymore Google has long been famous for its colorful offices and perks which have included all you can eat food laundry services and free massages Its executives boasted about being one of the first big U S companies to send workers home in March  as the pandemic began to spread Google has pitched its video conferencing and cloud services to other companies as ways to enable remote work recreation and education But it s also been one of the biggest companies pushing for a return to the office Advertisement The company began requiring workers to go in to their offices three days a week in April  but many have simply ignored the requirements with attendance being enforced in a spotty way depending on a person s manager and department Many of Google s gleaming offices including its giant new building in Mountain View Calif have been operating well under capacity We ve heard from Googlers that those who spend at least three days a week in the office feel more connected to other Googlers and that this effect is magnified when teammates work from the same location Cicconi said in the memo Of course not everyone believes in magical hallway conversations but there s no question that working together in the same room makes a positive difference The new message from management that not coming in could be noted on a person s performance review was seen as the most aggressive attempt yet to get people to come into an office said one Google employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation It could lead to many more workers quitting or being fired adding to the thousands Google laid off in January they said Advertisement Our hybrid approach is designed to incorporate the best of being together in person with the benefits of working from home for part of the week Now that we re more than a year into this way of working we re formally integrating this approach into all of our workplace policies Google spokesperson Ryan Lamont said Meanwhile Salesforce is trying an unusual tactic to get workers in the door The company is planning to donate  to local charities for every day an employee comes into offices from June  to  an initiative that was first reported by Fortune Salesforce will also donate to charity for each remote employee who attends a company event during this window Giving back is deeply embedded in everything we do and we re proud to introduce Connect for Good to encourage employees to help raise  million for local nonprofits Annie Vincent director of corporate communications at Salesforce said in a statement to The Post Advertisement With nearly   employees in San Francisco Salesforce is the largest tech employer based in the city where office vacancy has climbed to a record high of  percent Salesforce is part of that retreat As of March the management software company has shed  million square feet of office space from its  story headquarters that towers over San Francisco as its tallest building This time last year Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was voicing staunch criticism of the strict return to office mandates some executives were handing down arguing that they were never going to work and touting Salesforce s work from anywhere model as a key recruiting advantage in a tight labor market But Benioff s stance has shifted as economic conditions worsened and mass layoffs wracked Silicon Valley The company slashed its workforce by  percent or more than   positions in January and the door for more cuts has been left open In addition to pruning its office footprint Salesforce ditched the  acre Trailblazer Ranch in Scotts Valley Calif which it leased last year as a haven for onboarding and team building Employees could take yoga and cooking classes go on nature walks and meditate Advertisement It s not just tech giants reversing course on remote work At Farmers Insurance which told employees last year that the majority could work remotely CEO Raul Vargas announced last month that the company is mandating three days a week in offices for employees who live within  miles of an office starting in September Roughly  percent of the company s   person workforce will be hybrid while other roles will be remote or fully in office according to Carly Kraft a spokesperson for Farmers Insurance The mandate is meant to foster greater collaboration creativity and innovation while also providing better opportunities for learning training mentoring career development and organic interaction Kraft told The Post Kraft added that while remote work made sense when the pandemic began a hybrid approach works best for the company now A mix of working in office and from home remains the dominant mode for white collar employees with  percent of remote capable jobs operating under hybrid schedules as of February according to Gallup s hybrid work indicator Advertisement Kraft noted that the decision was carried out with a great deal of thoughtfulness including giving employees three months to prepare But the move was nonetheless met with angst from employees who had oriented their lives around the ability to work remotely selling cars and moving to cities far from Farmers offices according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal Farmers justification echoes arguments that have been made by executives ranging from Disney s Bob Iger to Amazon s Andy Jassy in pushing for a strong return to offices Workers at those companies have signed petitions pushing back on requests to return to offices arguing that doing so would impinge on their productivity mental health and work life balance Many experts believe that office mandates aren t enough to create stronger company cultures Cali Williams Yost a longtime flexible work strategist said that many executives are trying to avoid the hard work of figuring out how to make time spent together translate into meaningful connections as opposed to simply ordering a certain amount of days in office Sure people will comply because they don t want to lose their jobs but is that an engaged focused intentional way of working for somebody Williams asked GiftOutline Gift Article,the-washington-post,The Washington Post
